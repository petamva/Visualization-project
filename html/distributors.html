            The film industry or motion picture industry, comprises the technological and commercial institutions of film-making,
            i.e., film production companies, film studios, cinematography, animation, film production, screenwriting,
            pre-production, post production, film festivals, distribution and actors, film directors and other film crew personnel.
            Though the expense involved in making films almost immediately led film production to concentrate under the
            auspices of standing production companies, advances in affordable film making equipment, and expansion
            of opportunities to acquire investment capital from outside the film industry itself, have allowed independent
            film production to evolve(source:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry">Wikipedia</a>).

        <p class = "text">Since the dawn of film-making, the U.S. film studios have dominated both American cinema and the global
            film industry. U.S. studios have benefited from a strong first-mover advantage in that they were the
            first to industrialize film-making and master the art of mass-producing and distributing high-quality
            films with broad cross-cultural appeal. In the last 15 years the Big Six majors – Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros.,
            Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures – have almost completely monopolised the
            competition making it very rare for a film to reach a broad international audience on multiple continents
            and in multiple languages without being picked up by one them
            (source:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry">Wikipedia</a>).

                    Big six share almost 80% of the total market in the last 15 years (1995-2020).
                    Each "piece" of the donut represents a studio. The "donut" is made ring-like on purpose:
                    one can compare one studio to the other based on arc length rather than size.
                    The chart is interactive too: hover over each studio with your mouse to find out its total gross over this period!

            <p class="text">
                Today, the Big six majors routinely distribute hundreds of films every year into all
                significant international markets (that is, where discretionary income is high enough
                for consumers to afford to watch films). The Big Six major studios
                are primarily backers and distributors of films whose actual production is largely handled by
                independent companies – either long-running entities or ones created for and dedicated to the making
                of a specific film. The specialty divisions often simply acquire distribution rights to pictures in
                which the studio has had no prior involvement. While the majors still do a modicum of true production,
                their activities are focused more in the areas of development, financing, marketing, and merchandising
                (source:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry">Wikipedia</a>).

                The diagram above describes yearly releases from 1995 to 2020 where the blue line represents Big 6
                releases combined and the red one all of the rest. It is clear that major studio releases are
                double as many as the rest. What also can be inferred from the chart is that in general
                film release numbers are gradually declining from 2006 and after.

            <p class="text">
                Box office business can be measured in the terms of the number of tickets sold or the amount
                of money raised by ticket sales (revenue). The projection and analysis of these earnings is
                very important for the creative industries and often a source of interest for fans. This is
                predominant in the Hollywood Film industry
                (source:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry">Wikipedia</a>).

                The line chart above presents a time series of annual US box office for the past 15 years along
                with ticket sales since the one is strongly tied to the other. Since 2002 ticket sales have been
                decreasing in contrast to the box office, meaning that audience sizes have been shrinking as years
                go by but ticket prices have been rising. Hover over each legend for a discrete view of each quantity.
