        Genre is most popularly known as a category of literature, music,
        or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken,
        audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres
        can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional.
        Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent
        new genres and discontinue the use of old ones.Genres refers to recurring,
        repeating and similar, familiar or instantly-recognizable patterns, styles,
        themes, syntax, templates, paradigms, motifs, rules or generic conventions
        (source:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry">Wikipedia</a>).

        <h1 class = "header2">Film Genres</h1>
        <p class = "text">Film genres are various forms or identifiable types, categories,
            classifications or groups of films.The basic genres of film can be regarded as
            drama, in the feature film and most cartoons, and documentary. Most dramatic
            feature films, especially from Hollywood fall fairly comfortably into one of
            a long list of film genres such as the Western, war film, horror film, romantic
            comedy film, musical, crime film, and many others. Many of these genres have
            a number of subgenres,for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national
            style,for example in the Indian Bollywood musical
            (source:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry">Wikipedia</a>).

            The above force diagram reflects almost 100 years of film making. Every
            circle represents a genre, its size depicting the frequency of films produced
            in the last 100 years that belong to that particular genre. Some genres
            are more strongly connected than others but they altogether form the visual-art form
            that we know as Film.

        <p class="text">
            When you think of the most profitable movies at the box office,
            you probably think of the Hollywood blockbusters - films that grab
            headlines because of their huge budgets and equally huge profits,
            like "Avatar," "Titanic" and "Pirates of the Caribbean." However,
            when it comes down to it, these aren't the movies that bring in
            the most return on investment for their respective film studios.
            Most of the time, movies with smaller budgets provide studios with
            the most bang for their buck, if the film reaches a profitable state
            (source:<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0410/movie-genres-with-the-best-roi.aspx">Investopedia</a>).

            This barchart shows the average budget per genre from 2010 up to 2017.
            As one would expect Adventure,Animation and Fantasy are the industry's
            "big spenders" because of special effects and sets. When it comes to %profit
            though, Horror films blow the competition away with a whopping 1,100% profit
            per average. It seems that making a Horror movie is somewhat like investing in Bill
            Gates when he was still coding in his garage!

            What about yearly releases, budget, profit and ratings altogether?
            Wouldn't it be nice to have a chart that contains all that information
            so that we could compare the genres with respect to all of the above categories? We 've collected data
            from a three-year period and visualized it all in the same scatterplot.
