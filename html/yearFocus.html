            In this part our analysis narrows down and focuses deeper into
            specific seasons. First we investigate reviews across the board
            (IMDB,Rotten tomatoes,Metascore) of 2016-2017 releases. Are there
            any hidden trends? do film critics and audiences agree on which was
            the best film? Moving on we turn into 2014 and present all releases
            from a different view, extracting information and deriving statistics
            with an 'out-of-the-box' approach.

            Few things bring cinephiles joy quite like spending the weekend holed
            up in a movie theater, devouring the latest silver screen debuts.
            Though the biggest question is always, How exactly does one choose
            what to see? Well, that's where the next chart comes in. Obviously,
            there will be certain movies throughout the year that feel like
            must-sees just because everyone is talking about them. However,
            if you want to be a more discerning moviegoer, you can take a look at
            this diagram. Here we give you the lowdown on 2016-2017 releases —
            and the critics' verdicts on them. Then, you'll be able to determine
            which one is right for you

                It seems that rotten tomatoes' critics, IMDB and metascore ratings
                go hand by hand. The vast majority of films receive similar critics
                across the board. When audiences' reviews come into play however things change:
                people tend to be more generous especially with low-rated films.Things
                also seem to change at the top!

                The next section is actually more about comparing visualizations
                rather than extracting information from them. We have collected
                most of 2014 film and tv-show releases and we present
                them below in two different ways. A sunburst plot and a tree. Both
                diagrams are typically used for visualizing hierarchies and networks
                with connections between nodes and leaves. Here we implement them
                in a similar way grouping releases in genres, theatrical films and tv-shows.
                Which one you choose is a matter of personal preference: the sunburst plot
                is an impressive visualization full with beautiful colors and packed
                with information. The tree on the other hand is almost an exact opposite:
                it starts out as a simple small node and as it unfolds only relevant information
                is displayed making it a minimalistic alter ego of the sunburst diagram.

                This interactive data graphic is undoubtedly amazing. But it can also distort
                information in its attempt to persuade. It is actually quite easy to get overwhelmed
                by all those flashy colors and the barrage of information. As consumers of data
                graphics, it behooves us all to arm ourselves with a more thorough language
                and understanding of data graphics.

                It is clear that the tree diagram is following after Edward Tufte's principles:
                “Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity,
                precision, and efficiency”(page.51). After all less is more...
